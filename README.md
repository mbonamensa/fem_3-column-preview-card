## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I practiced my CSS grids skills. I usually like to use flexbox all the time because I felt it was the safer option.
It was fun using grids in this project and practicing how to use it with flexbox. 


### Continued development

I'm not closing my mind to grids anymore, I am going to use them together with flexbox in future projects when need be.
